ASSIGNMENT 2


Build a python code, Assume u get temperature and humidity values (generated with random function to a variable) and write a condition to continuously detect alarm in case of high temperature.


Python code:

import random 
while(True): 
   temp=random.randint(10,99) 
   humid=random.randint(10,99) 
print("current temperature:",temp) 
print("current humidity:",humid,"%") 
temp_ref=37 
humid_ref=35 
if(temp>temp_ref and humid<humid_ref): 
print("Sound Alarm") 
else: 
print("Sound off")
break
